# Smart Socket Energy Dashboard

The application integrates with smart sockets, communicating via MQTT protocol with the backend server. The primary objective is to create a dashboard that visualizes energy consumption data retrieved from the smart sockets in various formats. Additionally, the project aims to implement intelligent algorithms to optimize energy usage. Users will have the ability to manage and control the smart sockets directly through the dashboard interface, offering a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing energy consumption
